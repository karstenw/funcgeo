Functional Geometry

Original idea by Peter Henderson, see
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ph/funcgeo.pdf and
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ph/papers/funcgeo2.pdf

Implemented in Lisp by Frank Bu√ü, see
http://www.frank-buss.de/lisp/functional.html

Ported to Python by Will McCutchen <mccutchen@gmail.com>

Usage:

    plot(p, [f])

where `p` is a picture function and `f` is a file-like object which defaults
to sys.stdout.
